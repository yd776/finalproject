## FINAL YEAR PROJECT 
### VIDEO QUALITY ANALYSIS USING AI

### INTRODUCTION :movie_camera:

The number of people watching content for entertainment has grown tremendously in the past decade with the increase in use of streaming services like 
Netfilx , Disney plus, Amazon Prime Video.Several objective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms exist, whose performance is typically evaluated using the results 
of a subjective study performed by the video quality experts group (VQEG) in 2000.


There is a great need for a free, publicly available subjective study of video quality that embodies state-of-the-art in video processing 
technology and that is effective in challenging and benchmarking objective VQA algorithms
